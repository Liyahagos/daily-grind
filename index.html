				<strong class="feature">Coffee Special:</strong> Tigrays famous coffee is known as <strong class="feature">Bun.</strong>
				It is a very important ceremonial drink in Tigray. 
				The coffee ceremony is common through out the state and most of Ethiopia. 
				Fresh beans are roasted; while they are hot and smoking they are passed 
				around by the coffee maker usually a girl for blessing. The roasted beans 
				are ground and served in very small richly decorated ceramic cups.
			</p>
		 <p>
		 <br>
			The ceremony is typically performed by the woman of the household and is considered an honor.
			The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over an open flame in a pan.
			This is followed by the grinding of the beans, traditionally in a wooden mortar and pestle.
			The coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel which contains boiling water and will be 
			left on an open flame for a couple of minutes until it is well mixed with the hot water. 
			After grinding, the coffee is put through a sieve several times.[3] The boiling pot (jebena) is 
			usually made of pottery and has a spherical base, a neck and pouring spout, and a handle where 
			the neck connects with the base. The jebena also has a straw lid.
